### - 🔭 I’m currently working on 
[FOOSIE](https://github.com/FOOSIEngine), a lightweight 2.5D isometric engine using OpenGL and SDL, written in and used with C++. I plan to use this engine to develop games in the future.
I'm always looking for a helping hand on this project! Drop a PR or issue anytime and let's work on it together!
